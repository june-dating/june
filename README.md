# June - AI-Powered Dating App

## Problem

Dating apps are burning people out.

- **Swipe fatigue is real.** Roughly 80% of Gen Z users report feeling mentally or emotionally drained by the endless left‑right grind.
- **Hope is giving way to frustration.** Nearly 1 in 2 online daters say the experience leaves them more discouraged than excited.
- **Ghosting, fake profiles, and surface‑level chats** erode trust and make genuine connection feel transactional.
- **Curated profiles ≠ real personalities.** Users pour hours into photo‑filters and bio‑crafting, yet only 40% walk away with a positive overall impression.
- **Gen Z is voting with its time.** Speed‑dating pop‑ups are booming, proving that the cohort craves fast, interactive first impressions—not another swipe queue.

When dating turns into a checklist, connection becomes cheap. The market is primed for a model that restores depth, authenticity, and emotional payoff.

That's exactly why June—where there's no swipes, AI‑powered conversations, one meaningful match—matters now more than ever.

## Solution

June replaces swipe culture with one high‑quality, AI‑vetted connection.

### Five‑Minute Voice Onboarding
- Users chat with June's conversational AI
- Captures personality signals, attachment style, and interests
- No tedious forms

### Balanced Photo Drop
- Ten images: 5 face shots + 5 "life" photos that showcase hobbies, spaces, and vibe
- Vision models tag context and sentiment

### Swipe‑Free Discovery
- Instead of judging thumbnails, users browse full photo sets
- Filter by shared interests
- Enter an instant, text‑or voice‑based "pre‑date" with an AI avatar of the other person

### AI‑Mediated "Pre‑Dates"
- June's agent speaks as the other user, using their stated preferences and tone
- 5–10 minutes of natural conversation test humour, empathy, and conversational flow
- Far deeper than a hello emoji

### Mutual Vetting
- If User A enjoys the chat, they tap "Save Match"
- When User B later encounters User A's profile, her screen shows "He enjoyed talking to your AI"—social proof without pressure
- Only when both users like the personality and the photos does a real match occur

### The June Match Card
A share‑ready digital card featuring:
- AI‑generated visual of the pair on a dream first date
- A personalised ice‑breaker drawn from the pre‑date chat
- An optional one‑click link to schedule a real‑world meetup

### Come Back Only if Needed
June's goal is zero churn through happiness: users return only if the match fizzles—creating positive scarcity and brand trust.
